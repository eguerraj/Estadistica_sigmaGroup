# What you need to deliver

You need to follow somehow the **CRISP - DM** framework. To be specific:


> 1) Find a data set (at least with some continuous and factor variables)

Once you find a data set explain what is this data set, study where this data came from and why it was recorded. Remember to indicate the source of the data.


## Inspect the Data Set

> 2) Explain what this data set is about


At this point is ideal to understand that there is a clear business goal.




## Download the data

> 3) Be sure you can load the data set inside R. 

Check that the data is available and ready 
to load on R. You can take a look at the most important features as well.


## Inspect the Data Set

> 4) Follow the EDA to figure out the key points of your data project

Describe which techniques, statistics, graphs you are going to use





# Ideal Situation

The best project can certainly explain:

> 1) Problem Understanding

Take a look at the EEG lab assignment

> 2) Data Understanding

Take a look at the EEG lab assignment

> 3) Data Preparation

Take a look at the EEG lab assignment



# Deadline
You should deliver your *.Rmd* file and the report generated (only *.PDF*) before

> 22th February 2020


Be sure to include

> the GROUP NAME + Greek letter


And after that you can show a list with the names and surnames of the members of the group. It will be worth proposing task assigned and responsabilities


> Do not forget Names of the Group


> Write in *authors* the names of the whole team members
